   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**

   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update TypeScript types as needed

3. **Test your changes**

   ```bash
   bun run build:all
   bun run dev  # Test with the example app
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**

   - Use the PR template
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Include screenshots if applicable
   - Link any related issues

3. **Code Review**
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Keep discussions constructive
   - Update your branch as needed

## Code Style

- **TypeScript** for all new code
- **ESLint** for linting (when configured)
- **Prettier** for formatting (when configured)
- **JSDoc** comments for public APIs

## Testing

- Test on macOS (required)
- Test with multiple Electron versions when possible
- Include both ESM and CJS usage in tests
- Test the example application

## Native Development

### C++/Objective-C Guidelines

- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add proper error handling
- Use `RUN_ON_MAIN` macro for UI operations
- Document private API usage with comments

### Building Native Module

```bash
# Clean build
bun run clean
bun run build:native

# Debug build (with symbols)
npm run build:native -- --debug
```

## Release Process

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions, but you can also release manually:

```bash
# Patch release (0.1.0 â†’ 0.1.1)
./scripts/release.sh patch

# Minor release (0.1.0 â†’ 0.2.0)
./scripts/release.sh minor

# Major release (0.1.0 â†’ 1.0.0)
./scripts/release.sh major
```
